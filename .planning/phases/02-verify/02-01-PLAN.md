<objective>
Verify that the portfolio site is fully functional after Phase 1 theme infrastructure removal — no visual regressions, working navigation, working portfolio filters, and correct mobile layout.

Purpose: Confirm Phase 1 cleanup introduced no regressions before closing the milestone.
Output: Verified site with screenshots and functional test results.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Automated functional verification with Playwright</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Use Playwright MCP to verify all four VERF requirements against the local site files.

1. **Start a local HTTP server** in the project root (`/Users/kaywallaschek/Developer/kwallaschek.github.io`) using `python3 -m http.server 8765` (run in background). Wait 2 seconds for it to start.

2. **VERF-01 — Page loads correctly:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8765/index.html`
   - Check console messages for errors (browser_console_messages with level "error") — expect zero errors
   - Take a full-page screenshot (filename: `verify-desktop-full.png`)
   - Verify the page title or heading is present (snapshot should show the portfolio content)

3. **VERF-02 — Navigation works:**
   - Take a snapshot of the page
   - Click the "About" nav link (`[data-nav-link]` for About) — verify the About section becomes active
   - Click the "Resume" nav link — verify the Resume section becomes active
   - Click the "Portfolio" nav link — verify the Portfolio section becomes active
   - Take a screenshot after each navigation to document state

4. **VERF-03 — Portfolio filtering works:**
   - While on the Portfolio section, take a snapshot
   - Identify filter buttons (`[data-filter-btn]`)
   - Click each filter button and verify the active class moves to the clicked button
   - Verify that portfolio items visibility changes (items matching the filter are shown)
   - Take a screenshot showing filtered state

5. **VERF-04 — Mobile responsive layout:**
   - Resize browser to 375x812 (iPhone viewport)
   - Take a screenshot (filename: `verify-mobile.png`)
   - Verify no horizontal overflow (page width does not exceed viewport)
   - If sidebar toggle button exists, click it to verify sidebar opens/closes
   - Take a screenshot of mobile state

6. **Stop the local HTTP server** (kill the background process).

Record all results: console error count, navigation success/failure for each tab, filter button count and behavior, mobile layout status.
  </action>
  <verify>
All four checks pass:
- Zero console errors on page load
- All three nav links (About, Resume, Portfolio) activate their respective sections
- Portfolio filter buttons change active state and filter items
- Mobile viewport (375px) renders without horizontal overflow
  </verify>
  <done>Automated verification confirms VERF-01 (no errors), VERF-02 (navigation works), VERF-03 (filtering works), and VERF-04 (mobile layout correct). Screenshots saved as evidence.</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Human visual verification of minimalist theme</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
Present the Playwright screenshots from Task 1 and ask the user to visually confirm the minimalist theme renders correctly. No code changes — verification only.

What was built: Automated Playwright tests verified all functional behavior (navigation, filtering, mobile layout) and captured screenshots. No code was changed — this is pure verification of the Phase 1 cleanup results.

How to verify:
1. Open https://kwallaschek.github.io (or `index.html` locally) in your browser
2. Confirm the minimalist theme appears correctly — clean design with Inter font, no green terminal colors, no scanlines
3. Click About, Resume, Portfolio tabs — each should show its content section
4. On Portfolio, click filter buttons — items should filter by category
5. Resize to mobile width (or use DevTools device emulation) — layout should collapse gracefully
6. Review the Playwright screenshots captured in Task 1 for any visual anomalies

Resume signal: Type "approved" if the site looks correct, or describe any visual issues you see.
  </action>
  <verify>User confirms the site looks correct with no visual regressions.</verify>
  <done>User has approved the visual appearance of the minimalist theme after reviewing screenshots and/or the live site.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Phase 2 is complete when:
1. Playwright automated checks pass for all four VERF requirements
2. Human confirms visual appearance matches the minimalist design with no regressions
3. No console errors observed in any browser check
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- VERF-01: Site loads with minimalist theme, zero console errors, screenshots confirm visual correctness
- VERF-02: Three navigation tabs (About, Resume, Portfolio) all activate their content sections
- VERF-03: Portfolio filter buttons correctly show/hide items by category
- VERF-04: Mobile viewport (375px) displays correctly with no horizontal overflow
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-verify/02-01-SUMMARY.md`
