## v1 Requirements

Requirements for this milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Theme Removal

- [ ] **THRM-01**: Theme switcher UI element is removed from the navigation bar

### File Cleanup

- [ ] **FLCL-01**: Alternative CSS files deleted (style-surprise.css, style-playful.css, style.css)
- [ ] **FLCL-02**: Alternative HTML files deleted (index-minimalist.html, index-playful.html, index-surprise.html)
- [ ] **FLCL-03**: index.html references style-minimalist.css directly as its sole stylesheet

### Verification

- [ ] **VERF-01**: Portfolio loads with minimalist theme and no visual regressions
- [ ] **VERF-02**: Navigation (About/Resume/Portfolio) still works correctly
- [ ] **VERF-03**: Portfolio filtering still works correctly
- [ ] **VERF-04**: Site is responsive on mobile viewports

## v2 Requirements

None planned. This is a simplification milestone.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| New visual design | Keeping minimalist design as-is |
| Content changes | Bio, resume, portfolio items stay unchanged |
| Build tooling | Remains a static site with no build step |
| New features | This is purely cleanup/simplification |

## Traceability
