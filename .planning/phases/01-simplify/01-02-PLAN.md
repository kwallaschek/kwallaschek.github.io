<objective>
Delete all alternative theme CSS and HTML files from the repository.

Purpose: The codebase contains three alternative CSS files (style-playful.css, style-surprise.css, style.css) and three alternative HTML files (index-minimalist.html, index-playful.html, index-surprise.html) that are no longer needed after the theme switcher was removed. Deleting them eliminates dead code and reduces the maintenance surface.
Output: Only style-minimalist.css remains in assets/css/. No alternative index HTML files remain in the root.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Delete alternative CSS theme files</name>
  <files>assets/css/style-playful.css, assets/css/style-surprise.css, assets/css/style.css</files>
  <action>
Delete the following three CSS files using `rm`:
- `assets/css/style-playful.css` (Playful/Creative Coder theme - 22KB)
- `assets/css/style-surprise.css` (Neo-Tokyo Terminal theme - 33KB)
- `assets/css/style.css` (Classic Professional theme - 35KB)

Do NOT delete `assets/css/style-minimalist.css` -- that is the stylesheet the site uses.

Use `git rm` so the deletions are staged for commit.
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify:
- `ls assets/css/` shows only `style-minimalist.css`
- `ls assets/css/ | wc -l` returns 1
- `test -f assets/css/style-minimalist.css && echo "exists"` prints "exists"
  </verify>
  <done>Only style-minimalist.css remains in assets/css/. The three alternative theme CSS files are deleted and staged.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Delete alternative HTML theme files</name>
  <files>index-minimalist.html, index-playful.html, index-surprise.html</files>
  <action>
Delete the following three HTML files using `git rm`:
- `index-minimalist.html` (standalone minimalist version - 29KB)
- `index-playful.html` (standalone playful version - 29KB)
- `index-surprise.html` (standalone neo-tokyo version - 29KB)

Do NOT delete `index.html` -- that is the main entry point.
Do NOT delete `google64f0f9f3451338a1.html` -- that is Google Search Console verification.

Use `git rm` so the deletions are staged for commit.
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify:
- `ls *.html` shows only `index.html` and `google64f0f9f3451338a1.html`
- `test ! -f index-minimalist.html && echo "gone"` prints "gone"
- `test ! -f index-playful.html && echo "gone"` prints "gone"
- `test ! -f index-surprise.html && echo "gone"` prints "gone"
- `test -f index.html && echo "exists"` prints "exists"
  </verify>
  <done>No alternative HTML theme files remain. Only index.html and the Google verification file exist in the root.</done>
</task>

After both tasks:
```bash
# Only one CSS file remains
ls assets/css/
# Expected: style-minimalist.css (only)

# Only index.html and google verification remain
ls *.html
# Expected: google64f0f9f3451338a1.html  index.html

# No references to deleted files in tracked files
git ls-files | grep -E "style-(playful|surprise|\.css)" | wc -l  # Should be 0
git ls-files | grep -E "index-(minimalist|playful|surprise)" | wc -l  # Should be 0
```
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- assets/css/ contains only style-minimalist.css
- Repository root contains only index.html and google64f0f9f3451338a1.html as HTML files
- All deletions are staged for git commit
</success_criteria>
