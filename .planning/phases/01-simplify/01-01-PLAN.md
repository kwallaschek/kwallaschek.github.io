<objective>
Strip all theme infrastructure from index.html and script.js, leaving a clean single-theme portfolio.

Purpose: The site currently loads the neo-tokyo theme by default and includes a theme switcher UI, theme-switching JS logic, localStorage persistence, and the wrong Google Font. This plan removes all of that so the site uses the minimalist theme directly with no switching capability.
Output: Clean index.html referencing only style-minimalist.css and Inter font; clean script.js with only core site functionality.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Strip theme switcher UI and font references from index.html</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
Make the following edits to index.html:

1. **Replace stylesheet link** (line 21): Change `href="./assets/css/style-surprise.css"` to `href="./assets/css/style-minimalist.css"`.

2. **Replace Google Font link** (line 28): Replace the Share Tech Mono font link `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Share+Tech+Mono&display=swap` with the Inter font link `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap`.

3. **Remove scanline div** (line 32): Delete the line `<div class="scanline"></div>` and its surrounding comment if present.

4. **Remove the entire theme-switcher nav item** (lines 176-205): Delete the `<li class="navbar-item theme-switcher-nav">` element and everything inside it, including the theme dropdown and theme prompt animation. This is the block starting with `<li class="navbar-item theme-switcher-nav">` and ending with the closing `</li>` just before `</ul>` of `.navbar-list`.

Do NOT touch anything else in the file -- all content, sidebar, navigation buttons (About/Resume/Portfolio), articles, portfolio items, modal, ionicons, and script tag must remain unchanged.
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify with these checks:
- `grep -c "style-surprise" index.html` returns 0
- `grep -c "style-minimalist" index.html` returns 1
- `grep -c "Share+Tech+Mono" index.html` returns 0
- `grep -c "family=Inter" index.html` returns 1
- `grep -c "theme-switcher" index.html` returns 0
- `grep -c "themeDropdown" index.html` returns 0
- `grep -c "themePrompt" index.html` returns 0
- `grep -c "scanline" index.html` returns 0
- `grep -c "data-nav-link" index.html` returns 3 (About, Resume, Portfolio -- unchanged)
  </verify>
  <done>index.html links only to style-minimalist.css and Inter font, contains no theme switcher UI, no scanline div, and all non-theme content is intact.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Remove theme-switching logic from script.js</name>
  <files>assets/js/script.js</files>
  <action>
Delete everything from line 148 to the end of the file. This is the entire theme switcher section starting with the comment `// Theme Switcher functionality`. It includes:
- Theme switcher DOM queries (themeSwitcher, themeDropdown, themeOptions, themeText, themePrompt)
- The `themes` configuration object
- localStorage theme persistence (`localStorage.getItem/setItem('portfolio-theme')`)
- Functions: applyTheme, toggleDropdown, closeDropdownOnOutsideClick, addTransitionEffect, showThemePrompt, hideThemePrompt, startThemePromptTimer
- All associated event listeners (click, keydown for theme switching)
- The applyTheme(currentTheme) call
- The startThemePromptTimer() call

Keep everything from line 1 through line 144 (the end of the page navigation section). That code handles: sidebar toggle, portfolio modal, custom select/filter, filter functionality, contact form validation, and page navigation. All of that must remain exactly as-is.

Also keep the blank lines between line 144 and line 148 clean -- just end the file after the page navigation closing brace.

After both tasks, run all checks together:
```bash
# Theme infrastructure fully removed from HTML
grep -c "theme" index.html  # Should return 0
grep -c "scanline" index.html  # Should return 0

# Correct stylesheet and font
grep "style-minimalist.css" index.html  # Should match
grep "family=Inter" index.html  # Should match

# Theme infrastructure fully removed from JS
grep -c "theme" assets/js/script.js  # Should return 0 (no theme references at all)
grep -c "localStorage" assets/js/script.js  # Should return 0

# Core functionality preserved in JS
grep "data-nav-link" assets/js/script.js  # Should match
grep "data-filter-btn" assets/js/script.js  # Should match
grep "data-sidebar" assets/js/script.js  # Should match
```
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- index.html loads style-minimalist.css and Inter font with no theme switcher UI
- script.js has only core site logic (sidebar, modal, filter, navigation)
- Zero references to theme switching, localStorage themes, or alternative theme names in either file
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-simplify/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
