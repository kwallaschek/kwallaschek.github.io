## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Keep minimalist theme, delete all alternative themes — clean break reduces maintenance surface
- No build tooling — remains a static site deployable directly to GitHub Pages
- [Phase 01-simplify]: Deleted alternative CSS themes (style-playful.css, style-surprise.css, style.css) and HTML variants, leaving only style-minimalist.css and index.html
- [Phase 01-simplify]: Strip theme switcher entirely from index.html and script.js - no toggle, no localStorage, no alternative theme loading
- [Phase 01-simplify]: Remove neo-tokyo-specific scanline div as it serves no purpose in the minimalist-only site
